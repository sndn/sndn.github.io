# About

Ohh nice! Many many thanks from my side to you for showing the interest to know more about me.

I am Sourav Sen from India. I design &amp; develop websites and also do SEO for them. I write boring blog posts which no one reads. I do gardening a bit and sleep a lot. I eat lot of junk foods knowing that they are bad for health.

I mainly use Photoshop to design my websites. Sometimes I use Illustrator. I rarely use Figma.

I use Bootstrap and Wordpress to code/develop the websites. I don't have mucho liking for Wordpress page builders or blocks. I prefer the old school way of manual coding. I use Acf Pro a lot.

I am working for the web since 2008. I started my career as a SEO professional. While doing SEO I learnt graphics design, print design and web design. Then I learnt Html/Css using tables and div. Then when Bootstrap came, I started using it.

Currently, I am mainly into coding. 

You can [contact](https://sndn.github.io/contact) me if you need any help. You can even message me to say me a "hello". I am friendly and I will also send you a "hello" in return.
