# The Effective Tools in creating a Blog
<p class="date">Posted On {{ page.date | date: '%-d %B %Y' }}</p>

The whole process of creating and developing a web log site requires not only excellent skills like content writing, designing, and improving the aesthetics side of it but also the capacity to learn and apply the use of web logging tools. These tools will help your innate skills facilitate a better and far more beautiful outcome.

So, what are the tools that one can use? Are there any specific tools that are widely recommended?

One of the mostly used web logging tools that web loggers are using is the Wordpress application. This is a very powerful tool that web loggers can use in creating a base format and design for their blogs. The Wordpress tool is capable of giving a blogger the capability to create blog functions and features in just a click. The graphical user interface that the Wordpress uses allows for the easy manipulation and control of the whole web log site. Another tool that one can use is a graphic formatting tool; these graphic formatting tools such as Macromedia Dreamweaver and Flash are very powerful in graphic manipulation. Most web logs are incorporating pictures, graphics, and videos on their web logs to make it look more appealing to the potential readers.

There are web sites that offer the whole package. One of the more prominent web log maker is the blogspot.com. Although this has a limited capability in terms of skins and designs, the capability to create an overall web log is potentially possible using this application.
