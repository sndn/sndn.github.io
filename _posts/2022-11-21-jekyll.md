## Purpose
```html

This project serves as a starting point or a reference for building a statically-generated website using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and includes enough content and styling to demonstrate what a themed multi-page blog looks like, while the structure is easy to understand by keeping the number of files and lines of code low.

Run this project as a local web server or remotely such as on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or Netlify.

Only a simple repo configuration change is needed after you use this template - see the [Github Pages tutorial](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site) in Github's docs.
