1. **Build internal links:** This is where you link to other pages on your site within your own content. It allows Google to reach other urls within your website structure. If Google spiders can’t reach the pages, then they can’t be crawled and indexed effectively. Internal linking allows Google to better optimize similar URLs for their target keywords. This also allows pages to spread link equity and mutually enhance similar, relevant pages.
