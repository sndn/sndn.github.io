<p>Full Width & Boxed Layout Theme – Both are selectable with a single click, and you can also control the width of the site at it’s largest viewport, for ultimate control!</p>

<p>Iconmind Icon Font – We’ve taken the expense to include the stunning Iconmind icon font with Atelier, free to use anywhere within the theme. We’ve also included Font Awesome, so you’ll never need to seek out any other icon font.</p>
