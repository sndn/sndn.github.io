# The Importance of Blog Pinging
<p class="date">Posted On {{ page.date | date: '%-d %B %Y' }}</p>

Web logging or blogging in a more common term requires that it generates enough traffic in order for it to have good ranking on the site. In order to do that, you have to make sure that you constantly update your web log site so that readers and viewers of the blog site may find it very interesting and appealing.

However, making a religious update does not only mean being up to date; more to that, you need to make sure that the server instantly knows that there is an update on your web log. This will allow the server then to instantly relay or “ping” other web servers about the update. This whole process of “pinging” is what we commonly refer to as the blog pinging.

Web log pinging or blog ping is a remote procedure call that uses an extensible mark up language in order to transform its calls as a way of transfer mechanism. Most bloggers are using this type of mechanism because it allows them to have an easy method of “informing” people about the updates that they have on their web logs. What this process does is that it creates a way for the web log site to generate and create more and more traffic through the “announced” updates that they have.

This method of pinging is relatively free and that generally of web loggers can use this without having to register or create an account with any web site. Further, the blog pinging is effectively useful and efficiently helpful to the web log in terms of creating web traffic and higher page ranking.
