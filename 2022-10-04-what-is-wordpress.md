<p>WordPress is really a powerful (and free!) package of software that sits in the background on your web server (the remote computer where your domain is hosted) and performs all the technical processing that delivers your content to your visitor on their local computer. Once WordPress is installed on your domain you don’t need to do anything to make it
work. It just sits there and performs its magic entirely behind the scenes.</p>

<p>WordPress provides a WYSIWYG (‘what you see is what you get’) interface to you, the webmaster, that bypasses the need to know any HTML, PHP, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL or
any other coding language.</p>

<p>Once the hangout of hobbyists and bloggers, WordPress has now evolved into a powerful and sophisticated web platform that supports a host of features both for professional and
do-it-yourself webmasters.</p>

<p>The terms ‘blog’ and ‘website’ are now effectively synonymous as far as our usage of WordPress is concerned. Pundits use the two terms interchangeably because the
technology platform behind both is exactly the same.</p>

<p>WordPress is now actually used by some of the major players on the Internet as a complete Content Management System (CMS). And, in addition to the experts, millions of ordinary people and small businesses around
the world also use WordPress as their platform of choice to get a presence on the web.</p>
